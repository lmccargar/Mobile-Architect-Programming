**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The project called for an Android inventory mobile application. The UI needed to be user friendly for non-technical users. A data source (SQLLite) needed to hold user information and company products in this inventory application.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The mobile inventory application had an authentication and authorization requirement. A login UI was created to allow the end user to access the mobile app. In addition to the login UI, a registration UI was needed to set up users for the app. For the use of the app, there was a need to add, remove, SMS notification for low inventory used a UI for the day to day use of the app. 

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

Much of the techniques came from zyBooks assignments throughout this course. Our instructor offered videos which helped us learn about SQLLite. The developer.android.com was a great resource to reference for methods and syntax. If I were to become an Android developer, I would use the knowledge I have obtain from this course, my zyBooks print outs, and developer.android.com to be applied for future Android projects.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

When using the Android Studio IDE there is a JUnit 4 test built in to help test our code. This help aide in ensuring our code was functional and up to industry standards.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

Initially, there were challenges with understanding the Android architecture. How the XML UI tied into the Java logic. Once the architecture was understood, it became much easier to design the UI and write the logic. 

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

Writing the Java logic was the easiest for me when starting this course. The UI design is where I had difficulties, but this also demonstrated my success in this course. Once I understood the Android methods in mobile application development, I had gain the needed knowledge to build a successful application.
